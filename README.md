# Django for Backend Engineering:
This repository would take into account all my activities as I create my Django project for backend engineering.
Django is a python free, open source web framework, written in Python programming language. Django web framework is a collection of modular tools that abstract away much difficulty - and repetition in web development.
Django comes with ready-to-use features like login system, database, connection, and CRUD operations.
## Installation of Packages
First, we prepare our server for django. I did a number of installations to setup my project.
### Intallation of Paackages:
>Step 1: Install Python3 ( the latest version). I used Python 3.10.6 for this project.

>Step 2: I installed pip 22.0.2

>Step 3: I installed a virtual environment and installed django 4.2.1 into my environment.

>Step 4: I used Virtual Studio Code as my editor

## Django Project

Firstly, I activated my virtual environment 'source venv/bin/activate' and cd into my venv directory. Then I created my django project and app;
>django-admin startproject demoproject

>python3 manage.py startapp demoapp

Let's review what each new pages app file does:
